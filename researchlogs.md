Today, I want us to set up a piece of infrastructure for the course -- our research logs. We will compose these logs using the Collaboration/Google Docs feature on Canvas.

Here is an overview of how we will use the research logs:

>Each week you will document what you are learning in class via a Research Log Entry. The goal of these entries is for you to capture the in-process moments of insight and learning, including the posing of questions. For each entry, I will offer some brief instructions via the course site or Canvas as a starting point, and you are encouraged to extend your entries beyond these instructions as unanticipated things emerge in your work. These log entries will also serve as a resource for the self-evaluations that will be central to our assessment of your work in the course. 

To set-up your logs:

* You will need a Google/Gmail account.
* Go to the "Collaborations" section of Canvas. 
* Click "Start a New Collaboration." Canvas will ask you to authorize your Google account.
* Once authorized, you should be able to set-up your document. When you set-up your log, invite me as collaborator. You do not need to invite anyone else at this point. 

Once you have your log set-up, make the first entry into the log your responses to [this opening days questionaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iyjv4RqYMdUkCvtfzR5vm9AaYbJJLM/Users/musicforparkinglots/Desktop/OTHER/Desktop Dump [to organize Apr19]/ENGL_101_W19.md8_Y4Ghp187th0/edit#). 

You may format this initial entry your log however you like. A couple of options come to mind. One is to copy and paste the text of the questionaire into your document and then fill in answers to questions. The other method would be to compose your answers to the question in paragraph, or even essay-like, form.
